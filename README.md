# Media Control Knob and Scroll Wheel

This project is based on the Oversized Media Control Volume Knob project from Prusa Research.

I adjusted the code to more slowly increase/decrease the volume.
I also added a secondary operating mode that can be toggled by 'long pressing' the knob.
While in the secondary operating mode, rotating the knob acts like a mouse wheel.
